	 have a tattoo on my leg that is often mistaken for a firework or a sparkler. It’s a long stem leading up from just behind my ankle bone to two-thirds of the way up my calf. Fourteen rays shoot off from the central point of the stem’s top—lines of different lengths, some interrupted into dashes, some paralleled by a second line for part of their length. The only people who know what it means are those who are already familiar with the symbol, at least when they encounter it on my leg. But it was originally designed for viewers who would know even less what to make of it, if they even had the senses to process it.
